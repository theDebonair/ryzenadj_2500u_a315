# Custom Presets for RyzenAdj for Acer Aspire 3 A315-41-R45R
- ###### Acer Aspire 3 A315-41-R45R's custom power values for RyzenAdj.
- ###### These presets automatically switches between AC and DC power mode of laptop.
- ###### The credit for RyzenAdj goes to [FlyGoat](https://github.com/FlyGoat). I didn't made any changes to the RyzenAdj, just created some batch file(s) which executes through RyzenAdj to improve performance of my laptop i.e., Acer Aspire 3 A315-41-R45R.

## Installation
- ###### Use the Windows 'Task Scheduler' to run the presets(.bat files) at the Windows Login,
- ###### Open 'Task Scheduler', create folder within 'Task Scheduler Library' by right-clicking this folder, then select 'New Folder...'. Name the folder 'RyzenAdj',
- ###### Install all the templates i.e., Log On Switcher.xml, On AC Switcher.xml, On DC Switcher.xml for the Windows 'Task Scheduler' by going to ```Task Scheduler > Action > Import Task...```,
- ###### Templates must be installed within 'RyzenAdj' folder of 'Task Scheduler',
- ###### Create and place all the files(including the [RyzenAdj](https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj/releases), AC Switcher.bat, DC Switcher.bat, Switcher.bat) in the folder named ```RyzenAdj``` in the ```C:\``` directory like this ```C:\RyzenAdj\```.
